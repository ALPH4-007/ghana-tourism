    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Ghana, officially the Republic of Ghana, is located along the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa. It became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence from colonial rule on March 6, 1957, under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah.

Historically, Ghana was home to powerful kingdoms such as the Ashanti Empire and the Kingdom of Dagbon, known for their rich traditions, gold resources, and trade networks. The country’s history is also marked by the European trading forts and castles along the coast, including Elmina Castle and Cape Coast Castle, which played central roles during the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

Today, Ghana is celebrated for its political stability, democratic governance, and strong cultural identity. Its capital, Accra, is a bustling city blending modernity with historic charm, while the country as a whole offers diverse landscapes ranging from coastal beaches to savannahs and tropical forests.</p>

    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>Ghana is a vibrant nation with a rich cultural heritage shaped by over 100 ethnic groups, each with its own language, music, dance, and traditions. Traditional festivals such as Homowo, Aboakyir, and Panafest celebrate history, harvests, and ancestral heritage.

Ghana is also famous for colorful kente cloth, intricate beadwork, and handcrafted art, which reflect the creativity and identity of its people. Music and dance, from highlife and hiplife to drumming and traditional dances, play an integral role in social life and celebrations.

Historic landmarks, including castles, palaces, and sacred sites, provide a window into the past, while national parks, such as Mole and Kakum, showcase the country’s natural beauty and biodiversity.
